# Image Filtering and Edge Detection

## Description
This project is focused on implementing image filtering techniques and edge detection algorithms as part of the "Computer Vision Basics" course. The goal is to provide an understanding of how these methods work and their applications in computer vision.

## Technologies Used
The project is built using the following technologies:

    Python
    OpenCV
    NumPy

## Features
- Roberts edge detection
- Prewitt edge detection
- Sobel edge detection
- Canny edge detection
- Adjustable contrast and brightness
